# First Website

Here is my first real website that I coded during an internship of 1 month. I did this for my internship tutor to help her expand her business to a different type of customers.

## Insight

My website is mainly composed HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
I used links between sections to organize the page, an image slider, cards to illustrate the family in the company, a contact form and a Google map to find the company.

## Functionalities

My website projet is simply giving more visibility to the company by displaying pictures and texts to attract a more "modern" customer base. 
The main purpose is to make the customer sure that this company sells quality products.
